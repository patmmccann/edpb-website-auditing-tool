                <p>Information stored in browsers from a website can have multiple purposes,
                    either for the proper functioning of the website or for subsidiary purposes
                    such as tracking user browsing for delivering targeted advertisements. As
                    such, some may require consent before their use by the website, or third
                    parties, to be compliant with legal requirements, whereas others could be
                    exempted. </p>
                <p>Many of these trackers are stored through external SDK developed by
                    third-party companies,
                    as they share common properties between websites, such as
                    the domain, the key name or scripts. </p>

                <p>Knowledge bases can help identify these trackers, as well as the case
                    consolidating knowledge over time during case-by-case analysis.</p>

                <p>Identification of known trackers occurs while browsing by selecting a cookie
                    or a local storage's key line from the corresponding cards through the
                    logger panel of the internal browser.</p>
                <p> This same information is also accessible in <strong>More details</strong>
                    while assessing the legal compliance of an analysis. The expansion panel
                    <strong>Add this item to a knowledge base</strong> also permits adding yet
                    unknown trackers for their later assesment.
                </p>

                <p>Finally, the full content of knowledge is accessible through <button>
